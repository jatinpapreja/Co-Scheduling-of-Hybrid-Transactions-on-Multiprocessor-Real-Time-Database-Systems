In this project, we have implemented a solution proposed in above research article which considers the problem of <strong>Co-Scheduling of Hybrid Transactions on Multiprocessor Systems</strong> in such a manner that workload of processors is minimized. Two intuitive partitioning scheduling methods namely: <strong>Half-Half based Partitioned Scheduling (HH-P)</strong> and <strong>Partitioned Scheduling for Hybrid Transactions (P-HT)</strong> are implemented. Then, two improvement strategies are implemented namely: <strong>Efficient Partitioned scheduling for Hybrid Transactions (EP-HT)</strong> and <strong>Improved EP-HT scheduling (IEP-HT)</strong>. The EP-HT improves the efficiency of P-HT and IEP-HT improves the acceptance ratio of EP-HT.
</p>

**In order to obtain the schedules using the implementation, the input is taken as follows:**
* Number of Control Transactions: 3
* Number of Update Transactions: 4
* Number of Processors: 4
